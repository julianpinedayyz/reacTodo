# reacTodo - AI Collaborative Todo App

## ü§ñ Built with AI Collaboration

This project demonstrates the power of human-AI collaboration in software development. The entire application was built through iterative conversations with advanced AI models like **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** and **GPT-4o**. This README itself was generated through the same collaborative process!

The code structure, component design, accessibility features, and visual styling were all developed through a conversational approach with AI, showing how developers can leverage these tools to accelerate development while maintaining high-quality code.
